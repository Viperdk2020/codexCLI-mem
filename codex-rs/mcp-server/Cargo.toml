#
# codex-core contains optional functionality that is gated behind the "cli"
# feature. Unfortunately there is an unconditional reference to a module that
# is only compiled when the feature is enabled, which breaks the build when
# the default (no-feature) variant is used.
#
# We therefore explicitly enable the "cli" feature when codex-mcp-server pulls
# in codex-core so that the required symbols are present.  This does _not_
# change the public API of codex-core â€“ it merely opts into compiling the
# extra, feature-gated source files so the build succeeds.
